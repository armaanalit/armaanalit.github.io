                    <u>Western Blot:</u> Western blot is a laboratory technique used to detect and analyze specific proteins in
                    a sample by separating them via gel electrophoresis, transferring them to a membrane, and using
                    antibodies to visualize the target protein. I gained this skill through my experience as a Research
                    Assistant at UIC.
